# PaCaOmicsDATA
Processed dataset of the PaCaOmics clinical trial (NCT01692873) study on pancreatic adenocarcinoma patient-derived xenografts.



List of datasets:

#### RNAseq-based transcriptome

Transcriptome data is available for the human/tumor compartment as well as the murine/stromal compartment. SMAP (github.com/RemyNicolle/SMAP) was used to seperate specie-specific RNAseq reads.

Datasets are available as either raw counts, to be able to use any differential analysis method (Limma-Voom with Upper-Quartile normalization in the original study), or normalized counts.

Another dataset is available to be able to compare expression levels between human/tumor and murine/stroma.
